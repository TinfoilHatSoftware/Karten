2d game engine coded and developed by a group of students all at Odyssey Middle School in San Mateo, CA. Currently a work in progress.
A game that will run on the platform has already been planned.
There is currently no documentation.
The application ONLY supports Python 3.2, due to some version-specific uses of the 'imp' module.
Have fun.
